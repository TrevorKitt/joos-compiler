List of restrictions, each of where it needs to be checked for:

From Assignment 1 specifications:
- The program is written in ASCII 0-127 (scanner)
- A class cannot be both abstract and final (weeder)
- A method has a body if and only if it is neither abstract nor native (weeder)
- A static cannot be method cannot be final (weeder)
- A native method must be static (weeder)
- The type void may only be used as the return type of a method (parser)
- A formal parameter of a method must not have an initializer (parser)
- A class/interface must be declared in a .java file with the same base name as the class/interface (weeder)
  Note: The grammar already ensures that in a single file there can only be either a class/interface and only one of them
- An interface cannot contain fields or constructors (parser)
- No field can be final (parser)
- No multidimensional array types or array creation expressions are allowed (parser)
- A method or constructor must not contain explicit this() or super() calls (parser)

From https://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs444/joos.html:

Miscellaneus
============
- No repeating modifiers (unsure whether this holds in Joos 1W)

Class Structure
===============
- No package private interfaces/classes i.e public needs to be present at all times for interfaces/classes (weeder)
- No package private fields i.e protected/public needs to be present at all times for fields (weeder)
- Can't have multiple fields declaration e.g int a,b,c (parser)
- No nested types (parser)

Method and field access
=======================
- No closest match method overloading (some other stage)
- No implicit this class for static fields/methods (weeder)
- No array method call (weeder)
- No super method call (parser)
- No super field access (weeder)
- No non-static access of field/method (weeder)

Modifiers
=========
- Final field declaration (parser)
- No synchronized/transient/strictfp/volatile (scanner) -> further functionality needed
- No package private methods and constructors (weeder)
- No package private fields (weeder)
- No private fields/methods/constructors (scanner) -> further functionality needed
- No final formals/locals (parser)

Constructors
============
- No omitted local initializer (weeder)
- No local variable in own initializer (weeder)
- No multipler variables per declaration (parser)

Control flow
============
- No general for (parser)
- No do-while, switch, break, continue, labeled statement, synchronized statement (scanner) -> further functionality needed

Exceptions
==========
- No throws, throw, try/catch, finally (scanner) -> further functionality needd

Types
=====
- No unicode escapes (parser)
- No class literals (weeder)
- No octal and hex literals (scanner) -> further functionality needed
- No long literals (scanner) -> further functionality needed
- No floating point literals (scanner) -> further functionality needed
- No array data (parser)

Operations
==========
- No bitwise operations (context-sensitive analysis)
- No increment and decrement, assignment operations, unary plus, choice, bit shift (scanner) -> further functionality needed
- No implicit integer constant casts (weeder)
